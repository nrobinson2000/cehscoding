Here are the founders of CEHS Coding. Founders can [edit this page on GitHub.](https://github.com/cehs/cehs.github.io/blob/master/pages/founders.md)

## Nathan Robinson

Nathan loves to develop tools and make embedded projects.  His favorite device is the [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit), a Wi-Fi development board for easily building cloud connected products.

Nathan uses C++ when creating projects with Photons, Bash when creating tools, and JavaScript when creating responsive websites.

Nathan's full portfolio of projects and achievements can be found at [nrobinson2000.me](http://nrobinson2000.me).

Nathan is the manager of the CEHS Coding website, Twitter and Slack. He also leads the club meetings.

## William Jordan
William is a freshman who's only been coding for a couple of months. His favorite place to code is [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/SinBADCEHS/kx7f6e66/6/).

William uses Javascript and HTML5 for most of his projects (so far only games).

He really wants to learn more about HTML5 through this club.
