## Nathan Robinson

Nathan loves to develop tools and make embedded projects.  His favorite device is the [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit), a Wi-Fi development board for easily building cloud connected products.

Nathan uses C++ when creating projects with Photons, Bash when creating tools, and JavaScript when creating responsive websites.
