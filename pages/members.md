## Benjamin Keller

Benjamin Keller if a relatively new to programming, and has been working to improve his skills over the past two years. He has been working in JavaScript, Python, and Java. He is also one of the original founders of the club and has the desire to work with others in order to create something interesting. With the help of Mrs. Raspiller, he was able to bring back AP Computer Science to Cape Elizabeth Schools and hopes that it keeps it steam even after he graduates.

## William Jordan
William is a freshman who's only been coding for a couple of months. His favorite place to code is [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/SinBADCEHS/kx7f6e66/6/).

William uses Javascript and HTML5 for most of his projects (so far only games).

He really wants to learn more about HTML5 through this club.
